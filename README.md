##🧑‍💻 About me.


I'm a **freelance full-stack developer** and **electronics engineer**, focused in embedded systems and web apps.
I developed many tools for increase my work productivity and currently, I'm looking for a job that allows me improve my programming skills become part of a work team

My most recently project is an **IoT** platform, I developed completely alone.
- it has a **NodeJS** server for user and device register on a **MongoDB** database, currently I'm migrating it to an **SQL** database.
- also has a **ReactJS** front-end for allow user control and manage devices, you can find a demo in the next link <https://smarthomefe-git-demo-emiliano-dovichis-projects.vercel.app/>.
- I developed too different firmwares for IoT devices using **ESP32** and **ESP8266** MCU's and **MQTT protocol** for ligth control, temperature control and door opening.
